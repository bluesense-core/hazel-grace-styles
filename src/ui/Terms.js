                                    Bespoke outfits require at least one week’s
                                    notice if changes want to be made to the
                                    outfit, to change the date, or to cancel.
                                    You will be required to pay the full amount
                                    if the order is cancelled with less notice.
                                    This does not apply to orders that have
                                    contracts.
